# Implement-and-Evaluate-Laplacian-ltering

The aim of the Course Work is using the uniform Laplacian Matrix to calculate the mean and Gaussian
curvature. And Use Discrete Laplace-Beltrami method to compute the mean curvature H.

To run the code, the LibIGL should be installed firstly, the steps of installing the LibIGL is showed in the txt file called LibIGL_installing
